# Downloads + How to run Cambridge

## Windows

Stable releases for the general public are available at [https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases). If you're unsure about which version you need, just grab `cambridge-windows.zip`, extract it anywhere and you're good to go! Just run the .exe file and you can start playing.

However, If you'd like to try out the newest stuff or contribute to the project, you'll want to grab the bleeding edge version. **Keep in mind that this is an unstable version and there is a chance that the game might crash.** If you'd like to proceed, you'll need to have LÖVE installed. If you don't have it, go to [https://love2d.org/](https://love2d.org/) to download it, and then download the source code for Cambridge over at [https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/archive/master.zip). Extract the .zip file, open a command prompt inside the cambridge-master folder and then then run this command to launch Cambridge:

`dist\windows\love.exe .`

For 32-Bit Windows installations, you'll have to run this instead:

`dist\win32\love.exe .`

## macOS and Linux

If you haven't already, install `love` with your favourite package manager (Homebrew on macOS, your system's default on Linux). **Make sure you're using LÖVE 11, because it won't work with earlier versions!** You will need it for both Stable and Bleeding edge releases.

For the Stable release, you can grab the `cambridge.love` file from the releases over at [https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases). Put it anywhere you'd like, open the Terminal in the folder with the file and then execute `love cambridge.love` inside the Terminal.

For the unstable bleeding edge version you can either clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge` in your Terminal or download the archive of the repoistory at [https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge/releases). From there, head into the repository folder (either `cambridge` or `cambridge-master` depending on which route you took) and execute `love .` - and now the game should run.

# Installing modpacks

Yes indeed, Cambridge supports modpacks! However, it should be noted that since these are not part of the main Cambridge experience, your mileage in terms of how well they work may vary. If this doesn't deter you, go to [the Cambridge Modpack repository over at GitHub](https://github.com/SashLilac/cambridge-modpack) to get a taste of the mod potential.
