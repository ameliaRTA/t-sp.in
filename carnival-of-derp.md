Because people forgot that Tetrisconcept exists and no one made a thread there.

"HURR DERP I AM HTE STACKIGN FASTS" - some uninspired fuckhead aka me aka who is writing this????????? mmmmmmmmm burgor

basically play T.A. Death except with different rotation systems. rules copied from Milla's message:
- don't make the game free (super302 and the like)
- hold and more previews allowed
- big mode allowed only on ARS
- game mechanics otherwise must be accurate, notably 3:25 torikan
- any clone that follows the above is allowed

you can submit multiple scores for multiple rotation systems, so a 400 in SRS and a 300 with DTET for example.

submit new scores on [the cambridge discord](https://discord.gg/AADZUmgsph) in #carnival-of-derp-scores
